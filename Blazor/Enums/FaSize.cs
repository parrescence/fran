/// adding <c>Size</c> to a component is never a visual change for a consumer who
/// doesn't set it. Each component tunes its own padding/font-size per step (see
/// <c>Blazor/ARCHITECTURE.md</c>'s "Themes" section on why spacing is hand-tuned per
/// component rather than a shared token) — the scale itself is what's shared, not
